## Project Description

The core of this app is found in the logic it uses to parse the text files loaded into a readable format inside of the book viewer.  Of special note are the helper functions within ```book_viewer.rb``` that accessed from within the ```.erb``` files while processing the dynamic HTML file to be returned in the HTTP Response.
