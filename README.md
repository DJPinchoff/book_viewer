# book_viewer

Check out this app deployed on Heroku:
- https://ls-170-djpinchoff-book-viewer.herokuapp.com/

The core of this app is found in the logic it uses to parse the text files loaded into a readable format inside of the book viewer.  Of special note are the helper functions that used from within the ```.erb``` files when processing the dynamic HTML file to be returned.
